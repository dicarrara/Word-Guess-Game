# Word-Guess-Game

Project Description

This is a simple hangman game with an volcano theme. It was written in Javascript, without any libraries or APIs (not even jQuery). 

To play, just guess a letter by typing your guess on your keyboard. If you guess incorrectly 10 times, you lose. If you guess the word before that happens, you win. After you win, you can restart the game by pressing any key on the keyboard.
